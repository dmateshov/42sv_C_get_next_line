## Get next line project
GET_Next_Line 
Replication of get next line function in C. It allows to read the next line from ending with a newline character ('\n') from a file descriptor. 
It does not require to know the size of the file or line beforehand. The goal of this project is to learn a new concept in C programming: static variables, 
and to gain a deeper understanding of allocations.
